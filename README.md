# wishListCore

I used Angular + Express + Mongodb. 

I can add a product to the wish list by entering the product's name, price, website link and note(option).

I can delete a product from the wish list by clicking the name of the product. Click on the website link will direct me to the link I entered before.

All the products on the wish list will store to the database locally.

# Here is the UI of my project

# How to run the app
node app.js to run the server.

Note: Mongodb and MongoDBCompass need to set up on the computer. After set up, create a database called "products", and a collection called "products"
